        Energy efficiency simply means using less energy to perform the same task – that is, eliminating energy waste. Energy efficiency brings a variety of benefits: reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing demand for energy imports, and lowering our costs on a household and economy-wide level. While renewable energy technologies also help accomplish these objectives, improving energy efficiency is the cheapest – and often the most immediate – way to reduce the use of fossil fuels. There are enormous opportunities for efficiency improvements in every sector of the economy, whether it is buildings, transportation, industry, or energy generation.

       <p style="color: black;

       margin: 20px;">
        Electrical energy efficiency is understood as the reduction in power and energy demands from the electrical system without affecting the normal activities carried out in buildings, industrial plants or any other transformation process.

        Additionally, an energy effi cient electrical installation allows the economical and technical optimization. That is, the reduction of technical and economical costs of operation.
        
        In short, a study on energy savings and efficiency will involve three basic points:
        
        Support the sustainability of the system and the environment by reducing greenhouse emissions as a result of reducing the energy demand.
        Improving of the technical management of the installations by increasing its effi ciency and avoiding stoppages and breakdowns.
        Reduction of the economical cost of the energy as well as the operating costs of the installations.
        From a technical point of view, four basic points are considered in order to have a more efficient electrical installation.

       font-size:larger;
       margin:20px;
   ">Efficiency should not be confused with effectiveness: a system that wastes most of its input power but produces exactly what it is meant to is effective but not efficient. The term "efficiency" makes sense only in reference to the wanted effect. A light bulb, for example, might have 2% efficiency at emitting light yet still be 98% efficient at heating a room (In practice it is nearly 100% efficient at heating a room because the light energy will also be converted to heat eventually, apart from the small fraction that leaves through the windows). An electronic amplifier that delivers 10 watts of power to its load (e.g., a loudspeaker), while drawing 20 watts of power from a power source is 50% efficient. (10/20 × 100 = 50%)</p>
       <ul style="list-style: inside;">
           <li style="    color: black;
           font-size: larger;">Electric kettle: more than 90%  (comparatively little heat energy is lost during the 2 to 3 minutes a kettle takes to boil water).</li>
           <li style="    color: black;
           font-size: larger;">A premium efficiency electric motor: more than 90% (see Main Article: Premium efficiency).</li>
           <li style="    color: black;
           font-size: larger;">A large power transformer used in the electrical grid may have efficiency of more than 99%. Early 19th century transformers were much less efficient, wasting up to a third of the energy passing through them. </li>
           <li style="    color: black;
           font-size: larger;">A steam power plant used to generate electricity may have 30-40% efficiency.</li>

   ">Energy efficiency and energy conservation are related but different</h2>
       <p style="    color: black;
       font-size: larger;
       margin: 20px;">Sometimes people confuse energy efficiency with energy conservation. When someone follows the advice on a sign that says, "Be energy efficient—use the stairs instead of the elevator," are they increasing energy efficiency? No. The elevator will operate less often, but it will still use the same amount of electricity when it does operate. Using the stairs instead of an elevator is energy conservation. Two or more people using the elevator at the same time is more efficient than just one person using it.</p>
       <h3 style="    color: navy;
       font-size: x-large;
       margin: 20px;">Energy efficiency : <p style="    color: black;
    font-size: large;
    margin: 10px;
    font-weight: 100;">Energy efficiency is using technology that requires less energy to perform the same function. Using a light-emitting diode (LED) light bulb or a compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulb that requires less energy than an incandescent light bulb to produce the same amount of light is an example of energy efficiency.</p></h3>
       <h3 style="    color: navy;
       font-size: x-large;
       margin: 20px;">Energy conservation : <p style="    color: black;
        font-size: large;
        margin: 10px;
        font-weight: 100;">Energy conservation is any behavior that results in the use of less energy. Turning the lights off when leaving the room and recycling aluminum cans are both ways of conserving energy.</p></h3>

        <h1 style="color: navy;">How is Energy Used Efficiently?</h1>
        <p style="margin: 20px;font-size: larger;">Energy is used efficiently by taking notable actions in our daily lives. As we use energy every day, we must consciously take action to use it efficiently. For example, turning off the machines when not in use, choosing energy-efficient appliances for daily use, and using renewable energy resources.</p>
        <div data-aos="zoom-in-down" style="    display: flex;
        align-content: center;

            <img  class="imgvol" width="70%" src="ENERGY-EFFICIENCY-NP.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p style="    margin-top: 40px;    font-size: larger;">
            Energy efficiency means using less energy to perform the same energy function like turning on a light, heating/cooling houses, driving a car, etc. The most common example of energy efficiency is using LED bulbs or CFL (Compact Fluorescent Light) bulbs to produce the same amount of light as incandescent bulbs. LED bulbs use up to 80% less energy than incandescent bulbs.
        </p>
        <p style="    font-size: larger;">
            Energy efficiency is used to reduce energy consumption by buildings, vehicles, machines, infrastructures, and other devices. When the same amount of output is produced with less energy, energy is used efficiently.
        </p>
        <h2 style="    color: navy;margin-top:30px;font-size: xx-large;">Here are a few ways to use energy efficiently:</h2>
        <ul style="list-style: circle;

    ">5 Ways to Use Energy Efficiently</h2>
        <p style="    font-size: larger;margin: 20px;">The concept of energy efficiency can be used in almost every energy-consuming service like lighting, manufacturing, construction, transportation, machines, etc. Using energy efficiently can reduce costs, protect the environment, and improve the quality of life. There are many ways to use energy efficiently. Depending on what energy service you are using, energy efficiency techniques are used accordingly.</p>

            <h2 style="color: navy;
            font-size: x-large;">1. Energy Efficient Appliances</h2>
            <p style="    font-size: larger;margin: 20px;">Using energy-efficient appliances can help save energy and cost. They include refrigerators, washing machines, thermostats, fans, heaters, etc.</p>
            <p style="    font-size: larger;margin: 20px;">We keep the refrigerators plugged in all day. It is good to replace old refrigerators as they can cost heavy energy consumption and repair. We should choose energy-efficient refrigerators when buying new ones. They are more sustainable and use less energy. With the development in technology, we must update refrigerators with energy-efficient and environment-friendly ones that are available now.</p>
            <p style="    font-size: larger;margin: 20px;">Washing machines also consume a lot of energy and water resources, especially when they are outdated. Therefore, we must use energy-efficient techniques to wash and dry clothes.

                Similarly, we should also update other appliances like thermostats, fans, heaters, etc., with new, energy-efficient ones.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="    margin: 20px 10px 10px 10px;
        ">
            <h2 style="color: navy;
            font-size: x-large;">2. Energy Efficient Buildings</h2>
            <p style="    font-size: larger;margin: 20px;">Buildings can cause the emission of carbon dioxide as they use electricity and fossil fuels. Electricity is the primary source of power in buildings. Every building needs an electric supply for lighting and using other electronic appliances like refrigerators, air conditioners, heaters, washing machines, etc.</p>
            <p style="    font-size: larger;margin: 20px;">With modern technology, there are many energy-efficient resources we can use in buildings. These resources provide the same energy service but use less energy. We can apply Energy efficiency in buildings by focusing on energy-efficient design and insulation.</p>
            <p style="    font-size: larger;margin: 20px;">For example, the placement of windows that provide natural heating and cooling will make it energy efficient. Similarly, weatherization or weatherproofing strategies that protect buildings from sunlight, wind, and rain can reduce energy consumption and optimize energy efficiency. It also reduces the cost of energy.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="    margin: 20px 10px 10px 10px;
        ">
            <h2 style="color: navy;
            font-size: x-large;">3. Energy Efficient Transportation</h2>
            <p style="    font-size: larger;margin: 20px;">Transportation is another sector that causes the emission of carbon dioxide. This is because they use high fossil fuels like oil and gas. The use of energy efficiency in transportation can improve fuel economy and protect the environment.</p>
            <p style="    font-size: larger;margin: 20px;">Similar to energy-efficient buildings, transportation also requires proper design to make them energy efficient. Designers must consider fuel economy when designing automobiles. Reducing vehicle weight, improving engine designs, using hybrid vehicles are some of the fuel economy strategies.</p>
            <p style="    font-size: larger;margin: 20px;">The best alternative is to use electric vehicles. Such vehicles do not consume fossil fuels and operate entirely on renewable energy sources.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="    margin: 20px 10px 10px 10px;
        ">
            <h2 style="color: navy;
            font-size: x-large;">4. Utilization of Free/Renewable Resources</h2>
            <p style="    font-size: larger;margin: 20px;">Using solar panels is one of the most efficient uses of energy. Sunlight is available for free. It produces 10,000 times the energy consumed by humans. We can use solar energy to make electricity for lighting and other purposes.</p>
            <p style="    font-size: larger;margin: 20px;">Similarly, we can utilize wind, hydro, wave, geothermal energy, etc., to produce energy services. All these resources are free and renewable. They are environmentally friendly as well.</p>
            
        </div>
        <div style="    margin: 20px 10px 10px 10px;
        ">
            <h2 style="color: navy;
            font-size: x-large;">5. Increasing the Utilization Rate of Resources</h2>
            <p style="    font-size: larger;margin: 20px;">Resources that consume high energy must be used to their full potential. For example, when using a washing machine, we should use it when filled with dirty clothes. It is energy-efficient to use the washing machine with full clothes once instead of using it with only half-filled clothes twice.</p>
            <p style="    font-size: larger;margin: 20px;">Another example is trains and buses that carry hundreds of passengers instead of those passengers using personal cars.</p>
            <p style="    font-size: larger;margin: 20px;">It is energy efficient to use buses and trains while traveling instead of using personal cars.</p>
